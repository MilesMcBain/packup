# packup
In the midst of hot and heavy analysis you can't be bothered scrolling up to the top to put in the `library()` calls. Let `packup` do it for you later. Alphabetically...and deduped! Because these things matter OK. 

A word of warning: packup is like an OCD robo-vac for your code. And just like a robo-vac, you need to take precautions against it spreading shit everywhere. This addin WILL CHANGE YOUR CODE. SAVE. YOUR. FILES.! Do it! Or I promise you Jenny Bryan will set your laptop on fire.

Otherwise, enjoy!
